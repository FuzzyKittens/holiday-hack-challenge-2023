## Conversations

Pepper Minstix

Initial conversation:

- Well hello there! I'm Pepper Minstix.
- Say, do you like cotton candy by any chance?
- I used to own a little cotton candy maker, but I like cotton candy so much that I decided to upgrade. Behold! The Cotton Candy Colossus 2.0.
- Can I interest you in free cotton candy? What do you say! They are absolutely amazing!
- Have fun on the Geese Islands! There's still more to discover --
- Like sailing your boat along the various coast lines to find new ports, catch some fish, meet new friends, or provide your expertise and assistance where needed.
- After you complete all the challenges, come back here for a surprise!
