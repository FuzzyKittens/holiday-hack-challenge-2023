## Objective

Visit Christmas Island and talk to Morcel Nougat about this great new game. Team up with another player and show Morcel how to win against Santa!

## Conversations

Morcel Naugat

Initial conversation:

- Hey there, I'm Morcel Nougat, elf extraordinaire!
- You won't believe this, but we're on a magical tropical island called Christmas Island, and it even has snow!
- I'm so glad ChatNPT suggested we come here this year!
- Santa, some elves, and I are having a snowball fight, and we'd love you to join us. Santa's really good, so trust me when I say it's way more fun when played with other people.
- But hey, if you can figure out a way to play solo by tinkering with client side variables or parameters to go solo mode, go for it!
- There's also ways to make the elves' snowballs do no damage, and all kinds of other shenanigans, but you didn't hear that from me.
- Just remember, it's all about having fun and sharing the joy of the holiday season with each other.
- So, are you in? We'd really love your company in this epic snowball battle!

After solving challenge:

- You're like a snowball fighting ninja! A real-life legend. Can I have your autograph!?

Santa

Initial conversation:

- Welcome to the Geese Islands, fellow traveler! This one is called Christmas Island. Nooo ho ho, not that Christmas Island.
- After countless years of shivering and shaking through each holiday season, I thought to myself, "Why not trade the snowflakes for sunbeams, just once?"
- Oh, the North Pole has its charm, but the bones do yearn for a bit of warmth now and then.
- The notion was suggested by my good friend, Chat North Pole Technology, or as we like to call it, 'ChatNPT'. That's the one we use, but there's a whole slew of other AI platforms. You should try them out!
- It came to me describing palm trees and gentle waves, saying, "Santa, let your holidays take flight to Geese Islands, where the warmth isn't just a setting."
- "There, every day is a sunny scene straight out of a vintage film reel."
- I chuckled at the thought, my belly shaking like a bowl full of jelly.
- But the AI persisted, "Winter's best kept secret: the balmy breezes of Geese Islands!"
- And I must confess, the sound of that did stroke my beard with curiosity.
- So, I called a meeting with the elves, the reindeer, and Mrs. Claus, of course.The elves were all a-buzz with the idea of crafting toys with a view of the ocean!
- Thus, we packed up our sleighs and ChatNPT charted a course for the Geese Islands, a tropical paradise just north of the equator..
- And I must say, there's something quite magical about a Christmas carol sung to the strum of a ukulele.
- After all, the magic of the holidays isn't in the snow or the cold, but in the love and the care that we put into each and every gift.
- So here's to trying new things, to following the sunshine, and to the Geese Islands, where the holiday cheer is sun-kissed and the Christmas spirit is as warm as the tropical breeze.
- And it's all thanks to a little nudge from ChatNPT.
- Now, why not start off your vacation with a snowball fight with Morcel, or check out my surf shack on the other end of the beach?
- However you decide to relax, be sure to soak in all the whimsical beauty of these magical islands, and enjoy the activities to the fullest!

After solving challenge:

- Congratulations! You are a true snowball fight champion and thank you so much for helping out Ginger Breddie!
- Oh, it feels like the warm and gentle winds are starting to pick up!
- The perfect time to head back to your boat and embark on an adventure to all the other whimsical places the Geese Islands have to offer!
- Safe travels my friend and thank you again for your help!

## Hints

- Its easiest to grab a friend play with and beat Santa but tinkering with client-side variables can grant you all kinds of snowball fight super powers. You could even take on Santa and the elves solo!

## Useful AI Prompts

## Approach

For this one, I started a random match making game, right-clicked on the game and started messing with the javascript vars in the console:

```console
player.health = 50000000000000
elfThrowDelay = 1000000000
santaThrowDelay = 1000000000
santaObject.health = 0
santaObject.name = 'Getting defeated'
```
