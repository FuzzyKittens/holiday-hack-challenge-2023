## Alternate approach

As an alternate approach, there are several ways you can interact with the javascript.  One simple approach is to simply right click on the lock, click inspect, and in the console type lock_numbers to get the output:

```json
{
    "first_number": 19,
    "second_number": 37,
    "third_number": 39,
    "bad_third_number": 19,
    "first_number_sticky": 14,
    "guess_number1": 9,
    "guess_number2": 4
}
```

Entering the combination 19-37-39:
